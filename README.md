"My lab3 project is an ongoing build. I'm very familiar with ERP systems (Enterprise Resource Planning), which are complete systems that handle everything from incoming customer orders to incoming payments. Having one system to encompass all parts of the business processes provides significant benefits for streamlining. However, it also presents a major breach-point for hacker attacks, although it makes preventing such attacks easier.

Anyhow, I'm not going to worry about any of that. My idea is to build the different components of an ERP, starting with internal orders. In this case, I will enable order-picking for internal production. In parallel, I will create a to-do or task organizing system so that it could be useful for me while building.

I don't know what the text below is all about; it's just automatically added by Next.js and other stuff. It's way too much to read for one person in a lifetime, so I'll just leave it for now and keep working on what could perhaps be a useful webpage one day ðŸ¤£."

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
