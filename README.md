My labb3 project and ongoing build. I'm very familiar with ERP systems (Enterprise resource planning). It's a complete system that handles everything from incoming customer orders to incoming payments. Having one system to envelope all the parts of the business processes provides significant benifits to streamlining. It does present a major breach-point for hacker-attacks however while also making prevention of hacker attacks easier.

Anyhow, im not going to worry about any of that, my idea is to build the different components of an ERP, starting with internal orders. In this case i will enable the making of order-picking for internal production. I will paralell to this make it sort of give it a to-do or task organizing system so that it could be useful for me to use while building.

I dont know what the text below is all about, it's just automatically added by whatever next.js and stuff, it's way tooooo much to read for 1 person during only one lifetime so I'll just leave it for now and keep making what could perhaps be a useful webbpage one day ðŸ¤£.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
